# robotic_arm_model
2D model of a robotic arm animated to move along a path formed by plotting a few points or a parabolic path
parabolic.m actually gives you coefficients of quadratic equation
these coefficients when given to robotic_arm_parabola.m will give you an animation of robotic arm being followed along the path generated by the function
robotic_arm_path_follow.m takes in points to follow and and gives you an animation of robotic arm being followed along the path generated by the joining of points
